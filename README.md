# ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis on Indian Kids' Screen Time (2025)

This repository contains a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of Indian kids' screen time patterns based on the 2025 dataset.  
The analysis highlights **usage behavior, device preferences, urbanâ€“rural differences, and health impacts** associated with screen exposure.

## ðŸ”Ž Objectives
- Understand kids' **screen time behavior** across age groups and genders.  
- Compare **urban vs rural** screen usage.  
- Identify device preferences (**smartphones, tablets, laptops**).  
- Explore the balance between **educational vs recreational usage**.  
- Analyze **health impacts of prolonged screen time**.
